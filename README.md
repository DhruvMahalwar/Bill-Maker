**<h1>Bill Maker Application</h1>**
This is a responsive web application for creating bills in a supermarket setting. The application is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Any products added to the application will not be saved once you close the application.

2. **Generate Bills in PDF Format:** The application can generate bills in PDF format using the jsPDF library. You can view and download the bills as PDF files, which makes it easy to print or share them digitally with customers.

3. A**dd and Remove Products from Bills:** When creating a bill, you can easily add and remove products from the list of items included in the bill. This feature ensures that you can adjust the bill according to the customer's purchases accurately.
